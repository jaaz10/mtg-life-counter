# MTG Life Counter App

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm a university student learning mobile app development, and I've created this simple Magic: The Gathering life counter app as a practice project. I know there are already plenty of life counter apps out there, but I wanted to build one myself to gain some hands-on experience with React Native and Expo.

## What it does

This app is designed to help players keep track of their life totals during a game of Magic: The Gathering. It supports up to four players and provides an easy way to increment and decrement life points. You can also apply quick damage with predefined values (1, 2, and 3) and reset the life totals when starting a new game.

## How I built it

I used the following technologies and tools to build this app:

- React Native: A popular framework for building mobile apps using JavaScript and React.
- Expo: A platform that simplifies the development and deployment process for React Native apps.
- React Native Vector Icons (Ionicons): A library that provides a wide range of icons for use in the app.
- Expo Google Fonts (Roboto): A package that allows easy integration of the Roboto font into the app.

## Getting started

If you want to run this app on your own device or play around with the code, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Node.js and Expo CLI installed on your computer.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Open a terminal, navigate to the project directory, and run `npm install` or `yarn install` to install the required dependencies.
4. Run `expo start` to start the Expo development server.
5. Use the Expo app on your mobile device or an emulator to run the app.

## Room for improvement

As a learning project, there's definitely room for improvement in this app. Some things I'd like to enhance in the future include:

- Adding the ability to customize player names.
- Implementing a history feature to keep track of life changes.
- Improving the overall design and user experience.
- Exploring more advanced React Native concepts and best practices.

If you have any suggestions or feedback, feel free to reach out or open an issue on the GitHub repository. I'm always eager to learn and improve my skills! ðŸ˜„

Thanks for checking out my MTG Life Counter app. Happy coding! ðŸ’»âœ¨
